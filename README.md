- 👋 Oh hi guys, my name @snfct, long story.
- 👀 I’m interested in way too many things, but in this context, I like studying coding, computer science, and physics.
- 🎮 I'm also playing way too many video games, mainly puzzles and rhythm games.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning general programming (with Python) and engineering (with Arduino), but I'm also interested in other things like game development and shaders Refer to StudyList.md.
- 💞️ I’m not looking for collaboration (for reasons mentioned above) but if you have some weird ideas I might help.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him (dia if you're Indonesian)
- ⚡ Fun fact: did you know?
